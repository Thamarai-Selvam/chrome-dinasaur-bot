 This is a python based app for Google chrome's offline dinasaur game.
It uses [pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to automate the GUI(yeah, you just start app,eat doritos,take a walk,do whatever you want.But, DON'T open any applications while running the bot).

## Installation

 First things first.
   Clone the repository locally.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Thamarai-Selvam/chrome-dinasaur-bot.git
   ``` 
    
 Installing the required plugins.
   ```sh
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```
   
## app.py
 You need to edit the co-ordinates where the dinasaur lies on your game screen.
 Also, you should edit the co-ordinates of the retry button on the game screen.
 
 (Use tools like paint.net (for offline) or [inkplant](https://inkplant.com/tools/image-coordinates)(for online) to get the co-ordinates.

   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
