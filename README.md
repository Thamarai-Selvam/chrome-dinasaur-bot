----------------------
   Before starting the bot some things have to be done.
   
   In the ```app.py``` file,
   
   ```python
        ReplayBtn = (532,434) #co-ordinates for the replace button 
        dinasaur = (275,448)  #co-ordinates for dinasaur
   ```
   
   Replace the co-ordinates for both replace button and dinasaur with your screen's co-ordinates.
   
   Use **paint.net** or **[inkplant]**(https://inkplant.com/tools/image-coordinates "inkplant") (online) to grab the co-ordinates.
